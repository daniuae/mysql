Snowflake Lab: Create, Load & Query


Goal: Create your first database & table, insert data, and learn basic querying – all inside the Snowflake web UI


Step 1 – Log In & Open a Worksheet 


1. Go to https://app.snowflake.com and log in with your free trial account  

2. You are now in Snowsight (the web interface)  

3. Left sidebar → **Worksheets** → **+ Worksheet** (or “New Worksheet”)  

  → You now have a blank SQL editor ready



Step 2 – Your Very First Snowflake Commands 


Run these one by one (highlight + Ctrl+Enter or click the blue Run button):

SELECT 'Hello Snowflake! I am ready!' AS my_first_message;


SELECT 
  CURRENT_WAREHOUSE(),
  CURRENT_DATABASE(),
  CURRENT_SCHEMA(),
  CURRENT_USER(),
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();


You just ran real SQL in the cloud!



Step 3 – Create Your Own Database & Table 


-- Create a database just for this lab
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE BEGINNER_LAB;

-- Create a schema inside it
CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA MY_DATA;

-- Switch to your new database and schema
USE DATABASE BEGINNER_LAB;
USE SCHEMA MY_DATA;

-- Create a simple table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TRAINEES (
  ID INT,
  FIRST_NAME STRING,
  FAVORITE_COLOR STRING,
  JOIN_DATE DATE
);



Step 4 – Insert 5 Rows Manually
INSERT INTO TRAINEES VALUES 
(1, 'Alice',  'Blue',  '2025-01-15'),
(2, 'Bob',   'Green', '2025-02-20'),
(3, 'Carol',  'Purple', '2025-03-10'),
(4, 'David',  'Red',  '2025-04-05'),
(5, 'Eve',   'Yellow', '2025-05-01');

Step 5 – Query Your Data
Run each query one at a time and look at the results below the editor.

-- 5.1 See everything
SELECT * FROM TRAINEES;


-- 5.2 Only names and favorite colors
SELECT FIRST_NAME, FAVORITE_COLOR FROM TRAINEES;



-- 5.3 Who likes warm colors? (Red, Yellow, Orange)
SELECT FIRST_NAME, FAVORITE_COLOR
FROM TRAINEES
WHERE FAVORITE_COLOR IN ('Red', 'Yellow', 'Orange');


-- 5.4 Create a nice badge
SELECT 
  FIRST_NAME,
  'Trainee #' || ID AS BADGE,
  FAVORITE_COLOR
FROM TRAINEES;




-- 5.5 How many trainees do we have?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_TRAINEES FROM TRAINEES;



-- 5.6 Who joined in 2025? Order by date
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOIN_DATE
FROM TRAINEES
WHERE YEAR(JOIN_DATE) = 2025
ORDER BY JOIN_DATE;


-- 5.7 Top 3 earliest joiners
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOIN_DATE
FROM TRAINEES
ORDER BY JOIN_DATE
LIMIT 3;


Step 6
Created a database, schema, and table  
Inserted real data  
Written 7 different SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, calculations, and more.

Optional Clean-Up
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS BEGINNER_LAB;
